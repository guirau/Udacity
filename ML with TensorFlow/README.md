# ML with TensorFlow

This repository contains 3 machine learning projects from the Udacity **Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree**, covering core ML techniques across supervised learning, neural networks, and unsupervised learning methods.

Each project contains its own detailed README with run instructions. All require Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook. For convenience, rendered HTML versions are included so you can review the analysis and results without running the code.

## Projects

### 1. Finding Donors for CharityML

**Supervised Learning** - Predicts whether individuals earn more than $50K annually using census data to help CharityML identify potential donors.

- **Techniques**: Classification algorithms, model evaluation, feature analysis
- **Dataset**: Modified census data with ~32K records and 13 demographic features
- **Files**: `finding_donors.ipynb` and Kaggle competition version

### 2. Flower Image Classifier

**Neural Networks** - Builds an image classifier to identify flower species using TensorFlow and transfer learning.

- **Techniques**: Convolutional neural networks, transfer learning, image preprocessing
- **Files**: `image_classifier.ipynb`, `predict.py` (command-line prediction interface)

### 3. Identify Customer Segments

**Unsupervised Learning** - Analyzes demographic data to identify customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.

- **Techniques**: PCA dimensionality reduction, K-means clustering, data preprocessing
- **Dataset**: German demographic data comparing general population vs. company customers
- **Files**: `Idenfity_Customer_Segments.ipynb`
